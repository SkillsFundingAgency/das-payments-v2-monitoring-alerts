The Payments V2 Monitoring Alerts function posts information on the operation of the Payments V2 system to the appropriate Slack channels for monitoring by the Payments team.

## How It Works

A set of alerts are configured in Application Insights by DevOps that will be triggered based on operational conditions, such as:

* Submission Job Failed
* Submission Metrics Generation Failed
* Estimated Provider Accuracy Outside Tolerance

When triggered, this alerts are set up to execute the Monitoring Alerts function using its HTTP endpoint, passing a JSON payload containing the Application Insights data related to the alert.

The function then calls the Slack API, posting the alert message, available metrics related to the alert, and a link to the Application Insights trace information.

## üöÄ Installation

### Pre-Requisites

* An Azure DevBox configured for Payments V2 development

Setup instructions: https://skillsfundingagency.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDL/pages/950927878/Development+Environment+-+Payments+V2+DAS+Space

### Config

For local running, create a file called `local.settings.json`

Populate as follows:

```
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
